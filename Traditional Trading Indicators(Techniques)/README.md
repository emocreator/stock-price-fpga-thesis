# University 1 Technical Analysis Project

This project focuses on various technical indicators and their implementation in stock market prediction. Each technical indicator is housed in its own dedicated folder, containing a Jupyter notebook explaining the strategy and its implementation.

## Project Structure:

- **Bollinger**:
  - `BollingerBands_Based_Strategy.ipynb`: This notebook outlines a stock prediction strategy based on Bollinger Bands.
  - `Readme.md`: Specific details and explanations related to the Bollinger Bands strategy.
  
- **MACD**:
  - `MACD_based_stock_prediction.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook focusing on stock prediction using the MACD technical indicator.
  - `Readme.md`: In-depth explanations and details pertaining to the MACD strategy.
  
- **RSI**:
  - `rsi_based_stock_prediction_strategy.ipynb`: This notebook details a stock prediction strategy using the RSI technical indicator.
  - `Readme.md`: Further information and explanations about the RSI-based strategy.
  
- **Stochastics**:
  - `Stochastics_based_Strategy.ipynb`: A notebook that details a stock prediction strategy using the Stochastic Oscillator.
  - `Readme.md`: Additional details related to the Stochastics-based strategy.

- `azaz.csv`: A CSV file containing stock data. The exact content and purpose might vary based on the specific analysis performed in the notebooks.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the desired technical indicator folder.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook for a step-by-step guide on the implementation and visualization of the strategy.
4. Refer to the specific `Readme.md` files within each folder for further details and nuances about each strategy.

## Recommendations:

- Ensure you have all the necessary Python libraries installed, especially `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `talib`.
- The strategies outlined in these notebooks are for educational purposes. Always do your own research before making any investment decisions.
- The project is divided into four folders, each representing a different technical indicator used in conjunction with other
- Please Change the "ticker" variable in each Python file with your preferred stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL).
- Please Change the path before running.
